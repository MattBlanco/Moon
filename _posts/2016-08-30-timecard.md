This was the first script I made using Python. I didn't enjoy the way the timecard was filled out on this site, especially if you had a consistent schedule. So I used Selenium to create a web driver to fill out my hours for me. The hours came from using the openpyxl library to read an excel file which contained my hours for the week. That way if I worked the same hours every week, nothing needed to be changed and I can just run the script.
